        "Comparison operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of the common comparison operators in Python:\n",

        "1. **Equal to (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 5\n",
        "   y = 5\n",
        "   print(x == y)  # Output: True\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   x = 5\n",
        "   y = 3\n",
        "   print(x != y)  # Output: True\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "3. **Greater than (`>`)**: Checks if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.\n",

        "   x = 7\n",
        "   y = 3\n",

        "   ```\n",
