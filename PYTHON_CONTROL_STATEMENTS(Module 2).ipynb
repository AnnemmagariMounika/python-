        "#### IF Statement\n",
        "The `if` statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "temperature = 30\n",
        "if temperature > 25:\n",
        "    print(\"It's a hot day.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Description:** This code checks if the `temperature` is greater than 25. If true, it prints \"It's a hot day.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### IF-ELSE Statement\n",
        "The `if-else` statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block if the condition is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "age = 18\n",
        "if age >= 18:\n",
        "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Description:** This code checks if the `age` is 18 or older. If true, it prints \"You are an adult.\" Otherwise, it prints \"You are a minor.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### NESTED IF\n",
        "Nested `if` statements allow you to check multiple conditions in a hierarchical manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "num = 10\n",
        "if num >= 0:\n",
        "    if num == 0:\n",
        "        print(\"Zero\")\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        print(\"Positive number\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"Negative number\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Description:** This code first checks if `num` is non-negative. If true, it then checks if `num` is zero or positive. If `num` is negative, it prints \"Negative number.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Python Loops Basics\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### WHILE Statement\n",
        "The `while` loop repeatedly executes the block of code as long as the condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "count = 0\n",
        "while count < 5:\n",
        "    print(count)\n",
        "    count += 1\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Description:** This code initializes `count` to 0 and prints it while `count` is less than 5, incrementing `count` by 1 each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### FOR Statement\n",
        "The `for` loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and executes the block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "ml_models = [\"Linear Regression\", \"Decision Tree\", \"Random Forest\", \"Support Vector Machine\"]\n",
        "for model in ml_models:\n",
        "    print(model)\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Description:** This code iterates over the `fruits` list and prints each fruit.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### BREAK and CONTINUE Statements\n",
        "\n",
        "**BREAK Example:**\n",
        "The `break` statement exits a loop prematurely.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for num in range(10):\n",
        "    if num == 5:\n",
        "        break\n",
        "    print(num)\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Description:** This code prints numbers from 0 to 4. When `num` equals 5, the loop breaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**CONTINUE Example:**\n",
        "The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for num in range(10):\n",
        "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
        "        continue\n",
        "    print(num)\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Description:** This code prints odd numbers between 0 and 9. When `num` is even, the `continue` statement skips the print statement and moves to the next iteration."
